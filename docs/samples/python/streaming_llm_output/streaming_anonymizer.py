"""Anonymize streamed LLM output with Presidio.

A streamed response arrives as text deltas whose boundaries are set by the model
and the network, not by the text. Analyzing each delta on its own misses any
entity split across two deltas, and the first part has already been sent.

StreamingAnonymizer holds text back until a segment boundary, then analyzes and
anonymizes each complete segment. Segment boundaries depend only on the text,
so the output is the same however the stream was split.
